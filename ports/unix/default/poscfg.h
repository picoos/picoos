/** Set scheduling scheme.
 * The pico]OS supports two types of scheduling:<br>
 *
 * POSCFG_ROUNDROBIN = 0  sets the standard scheduling scheme, <br>
 * POSCFG_ROUNDROBIN = 1  enables the round robin scheduler.<br>
 *
 * For real time operation the standard scheduler is the best choice.
 * Standard scheduling means, that every task gets its own priority, at no
 * time two tasks can have the same priority. On a 8bit system you have a
 * maximum count of 8 x 8 = 64 tasks, with priority numbers 0 .. 63
 * where 0 is the  priority of the idle task and 63 is
 * the highest priority.<br>
 *
 * The round robin scheduler allows several tasks to have the same priority.
 * The number of tasks is limited by the count of bits the machine type
 * variable can hold (see define ::MVAR_BITS for details). The maximum count
 * of priority levels is also limited by ::MVAR_BITS. So on an 8bit system
 * you can have 8 priority levels with 8 tasks at each level, making 64
 * tasks in sum. The priority level 0 is the lowest, and the idle task runs
 * there. On priority 0 is space left for 7 user tasks. Priority 7 is the
 * highest priority. Note that on every priority level is done a round robin
 * scheduling, that means each task has the same right for execution.
 * No task is prefered. If a task gives of processing time, or its time slice
 * has expired, the next task at this priority is scheduled.

 * task has a higher priority.
 * The signaled task will first start to run if the time slice of the
 * current task has expired or the task gives of processing time by itself
 * or the maximum count of signaled events is reached (see the definition
 * ::POSCFG_CTXSW_COMBINE for details, also the define
